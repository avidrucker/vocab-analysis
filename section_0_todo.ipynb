    "- ~~upload this document to the dedicated github project repository~~\n",
    "\n",
    "section 1 (questions) :\n",
    "- assert that each question is smart \n",
    "\n",
    "section 2 (data prep) :\n",
    "- ~~assign (in section 2) JLPT \"N\" levels to each word w/ a JLPT \"N\" tag~~\n",
    "- remove rare words\n",
    "- remove phrases, expressions, questions & sentences\n",
    "\n",
    "section 3 (analysis) :\n",
    "- read over modules 6, 7, 8 and 9 for methods of analysis, choose 2-3 that look esp. promising to use\n",
    "- explore 3-5 features for feature analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "section 4 (graphing) :\n",
    "- re-render all the graphs after you have exported the newest, clean data\n",
    "- assert that, each has a title, each has a human readible (ie. easily understandable) axis label for each axis that exists, that each category has a human readable category, etc..\n",
    "\n",
    "section 5 (presentation) :\n",
    "\n",
    "- save out csv after each section, label \"section_#_output\", import into the following section\n",

    "- consolidate all paper todos, critique advices, etc. to this document **in_progress**\n",

    "- create new graphs (use broad survey & quick correlation graphs from recent exercises/modules)\n",
    "- update presentation with new graphs\n",
    "- fix date conversions to occur before dataframe merge, not after **in_progress**\n",
    "- re-export Anki collection from PC into project, then unzip & rerun with this notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "- Remove sentences, questions & phrases to prevent skewing of data & to hone in on vocabulary trends first. The above can be added back, or analyzed separately, after. (remove sentences, questions & phrases, idioms too)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Before making graphs & charts, prepare a dataframe with only numerical data (binary, non-binary, and (?) both)\n",
    "    - ie. remove: 'Yomi1', 'Translation','Translation2', 'Translation3', 'AlternateForms', 'PartOfSpeech', 'Sound', 'Sound2', 'Sound3', 'Examples', 'ExamplesAudio', 'AtoQ','AtoQaudio', 'AtoQkana', 'AtoQtranslation', 'QandApicture','answerPicture', 'Meaning1', 'SimilarWords', 'RelatedWords','Breakdown1', 'Comparison', 'Usage', 'Prompt1', 'Prompt2','KakuMCD', 'IuMCD', 'ExtraMemo', 'Yomi2', 'Meaning2', 'Breakdown2','Picture1', 'Picture2', 'Picture3', 'Picture4', 'HinshiMarker','Hint', 'Term2', 'ArabicNumeral', 'CounterKanji', 'Mnemonic','SameSoundWords', 'Yomi3', 'gChap', 'gBook', 'semester', 'gNumber','Transliteration', 'SoloLookCards', 'TagOverflow', 'blank1','blank2',\n",
    "\n",
    "- use TPR list to apply \"demoable\" metatag\n",
    "\n",
    "done:\n",
    "- ~~Increase dataset to include all Japanese vocabulary from your Anki~~\n",
    "- ~~add todos from email reminder (see email inbox)~~\n",
    "- ~~remove words with 0 reps from primary graphing, as they dilute study consequence correlations/readings/analyses~~\n",
    "- ~~create dedicated github project repository~~ https://github.com/avidrucker/vocab-analysis\n",
    "- ~~link to presentation~~: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1UntQmGL2uhH9POCQzyVEh2j7qviHmrZjjyHJttlvVWU/edit?usp=sharing\n",
    "- ~~fix ordering (1) tag removal, renaming & confirmation (tag frequency), then (2) dataframe merges, then (3) addition of binary columns~~\n",
    "- ~~mark cells for export to sections 3, 4~~\n",
    "- ~~export section 3 & section 4 cells to next documents~~\n",
    "- ~~break up notebook into 5 sections/partitions as per \"DataScienceProcessTips.pdf\"~~\n",
    "- ~~import in Section 1 from personal laptop where question has been identified~~\n",
    "- ~~import in review (revlog) data (see model info here:~~ https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/wiki/Database-Structure )\n",
    "- ~~export all utility functions to be used in other notebooks~~\n",
    "- ~~add assertion to confirm that sel3 is empty (row size of 0)~~\n",
    "\n",
    "for next time:\n",
    "- we want to understand the words conceptually: abstract vs concrete, verbs vs nouns vs adjectives\n",
    "- conduct manual data entry to apply \"concrete\" or \"abstract\" to each note\n",
    "- inspect mod as a marker for 'freshness'\n",
    "- notes: logistic regression: classification/categorization\n",
    "- add 'commonword' tag to tags from 'PartOfSpeech' column\n",
    "- Increase dataset to include all of J\\'s, C\\'s, W's, and E\\'s study data\n",
    "\n",
    "Further Ideas:\n",
    "- generate power as work (reps) over time\n",
    "- use lapses to calculate efficiency per word\n",
    "- generate stress as ratio of lapses to reps, compare wtih ease\n",
    "\n",
    "questions worth asking:\n",
    "- which are the easiest words to learn first?\n",
    "- which words, when learned first, will set the learner up for better results to achieve their goals (depending on which goals they have chosen)?\n",
    "- which words were learned in context, and which without, and what were the memorability/retention consequences?\n",
    "- how might learning Kanji meanings affect vocabulary retention?\n",
    "\n",
    "0. ask some questions\n",
    "- Which learning vectors offer the best ROI? (long memory intervals for few reviews)\n",
    "- What is the cost of failure (forgetting & resetting memories)?\n",
    "- As stress (by-product of effort/difficulty/failure) & time/energy (resource) can be clearly metricized & visualized, how can learners best direct their learning efforts? (little effort over long time vs or big effort over short, or a goldilocks ratio per the person & their current day-to-day, minute-to-minute state of being)\n",
    "- What language/word features affect their memorability (memory durability, storability, & retrievability)?\n",
    "- \n",
    "\n",
    "1. import some data\n",
    "2. inspect the data\n",
    "3. determine what to do with the data\n",
    "4. do that\n",
    "5. make data observations & re-evaluate questions\n",
    "\t- what answers we we have?\n",
    "\t- what further questions are generated?\n",
    "\t- which questions remain unanswered?"
