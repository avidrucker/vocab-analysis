I couldn't speak, read or write Japanese when I first went to Japan. Simple yes or no questions, and asking where the bathroom was, was the best I could do. Two years of college Japanese, and for what?

Two study abroads later, I was finally able to hold simple conversations, but I still couldn't read or write, and many words wouldn't stick in my memory. The Japanese characters called Kanji were the hardest - like fine sand through my fingers, they slipped out of my head almost immediately.

I tried everything. I tried apps, I tried classes, I tried dating Japanese people. And then, I found Spaced Repetition Software. With the power of SRS, I was able to memorize over 10,000 words in Japanese.

Turns out that keeping words memorized is like spinning plates or juggling hundreds of balls. Despite my best efforts, I couldn't seem to remember some words for longer than a week or two.

Awareness is the first step. Which words were sticky? Which were were slippery? Here are some words that were especially slippery:

- there is group work (this is appealing)
