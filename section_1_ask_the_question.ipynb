    "A: Learning a foreign language takes energy, time, and focus. It also has a stress byproduct. For a learner/student using a Spaced Repetition Software (SRS), how can they further **reduce the energy, time & focus** required, as well as **reduce stress**, by adjusting the study **content** and their study **behavior**?\n",

    "Q: What are **the tools** in use currently to address this question, and **the alternatives**?  \n",
    "A: The popular SRS in use today (2019) are SuperMemo, Anki & Mnemosyne. Services used for L2 language learning include Duolingo, Rosetta Stone, and Memrise. The researcher has decided to use a dataset of vocabulary study data created in **Anki**. Cards were custom made by the student. The student manually added images, audio, meta-tags, & dictionary definitions to enhance, and teacher/native speaker input to verify & validate, some (but not all) of the data. With over unique 20,000 vocabulary items, there is a robust amount of data to explore trends, distributions, & conduct exploratory analysis."

    "Anki, the Open Source, Spaced Repetition software (& app & service), saves a student's data in a few locations. There are the \"Notes\" which are the raw info used to make cards (fields of vocab data, metatags, trivia facts, images, audio, etc..) Then there are the \"Cards\" which are the actual studied items, where the study overview data is stored (such as study date-times, repetitions (reviews), intervals (how long a card is to be remembered), lapses (forgets & subsequent interval resets)). Additionally, data concerning the entire collection is stored under something cryptically called \"Columns\". Lastly, there is a \"RevLog\" which contains all the study data in detail for each individual repetition (study datetime, card studied, etc..)
